# Ubuntu Setup
Being a fairly new Linux user, I find myself reinstalling the OS sometimes (because either I screwed up something or just for the sake of trying other distros). <br/>
However, I always end up manually installing the same programs.
Since I find it quite tedious, I decided to try to build a little script that does it for me.

## Usage
At the moment, this script is based on the apt package manager (up to now, I've worked only with ubuntu-derived distros). <br/>
To use the installation script, just download the `ubuntu-setup` file (that can be found in the `src` directory) and run it with `sudo ./ubuntu-setup`
